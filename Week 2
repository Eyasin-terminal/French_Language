"Absolument pas" in French means "Absolutely not" in English. It’s used to give a strong negative response, similar to saying "no way" or "definitely not."

Example:
Est-ce que tu veux venir ? – Do you want to come?

- Absolument pas ! – Absolutely not!

It's a polite but firm way of saying no.

Sure! In French, there are several ways to ask questions. Here are the main methods:

 1.Raising your intonation (informal):

You can simply say a statement with a rising intonation at the end, which turns it into a question.

-Tu parles français ? – Do you speak French?
-Il est là ?– Is he here?

2.using "Est-ce que" (neutral/formal):
"Est-ce que" is added at the beginning of a sentence to make it a question.

- Est-ce que tu parles français ? – Do you speak French?
- Est-ce qu'il est là ?– Is he here?

3. inversion (formal):
You can invert the subject and verb, which is often more formal.

- Parles-tu français ? – Do you speak French?
- Est-il là ? – Is he here?

4. Using question words:
For questions that require more than a yes/no answer, use a question word (like who, what, where, etc.).

Here are the common question words:

- Qui – Who
- quoi/Que – What
- Où – Where
- Quand – When
- Pourquoi – Why
- Comment – How
- Combien– How much/how many

Examples:
- Qui es-tu ? – Who are you?
- Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?– What are you doing?
- Où vas-tu ? – Where are you going?
- Quand arrives-tu ? – When are you arriving?
- Pourquoi est-il en retard ? – Why is he late?
- Comment ça va ? – How are you?
